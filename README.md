We see this world in so many ways. But it can be seen in so many more.

There's time. There's always time.

Don't let all those days, just become another life.

Make them the hours you spent, building for something greater.

Building you.
<br>
<br>

You are an engine. Beaming energy out to the universe.

You are a lens. That sees the world in a way its never been seen.

That's what I learned.
<br>
<br>

And the best part of all?

There's still so much time for more.
